# py-utils

Dear friends,

This is an umbrella project that contains a bunch of Python sub-projects. 

Since Python is almost the full-stack language, we chose it in favor of other languages. Python is cross-platform and almost universally supported. Except for browser front-end, applications written in Python spans all the way from IoT (Internet of Things, such as wearable devices) to backend server applications, to big data solutions.   

All projects under this group are intended to be practical. Some are boilerplate examples to be reused by the general public in the future. Others solve common problems in our daily life or coding. 

Additionally, these projects serve as educational purposes. We use these projects to train new hires. Through our daily development, we found that experienced programmers have their own problems as well -- for example, then tend to use Java-like syntax, which slows the code progress and makes the code base more difficult to maintain. Of course, you are welcome to submit your pull request to improve the code.
